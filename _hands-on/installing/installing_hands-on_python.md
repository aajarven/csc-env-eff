# Python

ðŸ’¬ To run Python applications, first load suitable Python module. CSC has several Python environments available, with focus on different
application areas.

ðŸ’­ For details, please see the [Python page](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/python/) in Docs.

ðŸ’­ By selecting a suitable Python environment to start with, you'll minimize the need to install additional packages.

## Installing Python packages.

ðŸ’­ To install simple packages it is usually enough to use `pip`:
```bash
pip install --user package_to_install
```
ðŸ’­ Remember to include `--user`. By default pip tries to install to the common Python installation location, and this will not work.

ðŸ’­ For more complex installations it is preferable to create a virtual environment. 

ðŸ’­ See instructions in our [Python documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/python/).

ðŸ’­ Also see the the pages for each Python environment so see any environment specific
instructions.

## Example
Let's install library called `coverage`.

- Start by loading a Python module and checking if the library is already installed.
```bash
module load python-env
python -c "import coverage"
```
- The error message is indicating that the library is not available:
```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'coverage'
```
- Install the missing library:
```bash
pip install --user coverage    # This may take a while - don't worry!
```
- Re-test if the library is available:
```bash
python -c "import coverage"
```
- This time there's no error message, indicating the import command was succesful.

- The library is installed in directory `$HOME/.local`

- To uninstall:
```bash
pip uninstall coverage
```
- Type `y` to confirm
