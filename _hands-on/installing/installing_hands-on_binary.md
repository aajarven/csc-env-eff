# Installing binary applications

üí¨ In some cases the software developers offer ready-made binary versions of their software. 
- If the binary version runs, you don't need to compile the software yourself.

‚òùüèª It should be noted that ready binary versions are typically not optimized for CSC supercomputers.
- The difference in performance will depend on the code, and on how the application was compiled. 
- Often the difference is just a few percent, but in some cases it can be more substantial.

‚ÄºÔ∏è Especially all MPI codes need to be compiled on the machine they will be run on to ensure correct operation.

## Example: Installing GCTA software

üí¨ In this example we install the binary release of GCTA software.

1. Go to the [GCTA download page](https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#Download).
2. Identify the Linux version. 
    - If several Linux version are offered, try find one with "x86" in the name.
    - If version are offered by Linux distribution, try first the versions made for CentOs or RedHat if present. 
    - Sometimes you may have to try different versions to find one that works.
3. Here is the link for the Linux version (accessed 19.07.21). Download the zip file by typing:
    ```bash
    wget https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/bin/gcta_1.93.2beta.zip
    ```
4. Open the zip file:
    ```bash
    unzip gcta_1.93.2beta.zip
    ```
5. The software is now ready to use, but you will have to tell the computer where to find it. 
    - Trying just the following will result in a `command not found` error because you are not accessing the right folder yet.
    ```bash
    gcta64
    ```
6. Try instead:
    ```bash
    gcta_1.93.2beta/gcta64
    ```
    - Or:
    ```bash
    cd gcta_1.93.2beta
    ./gcta64
    ```
7. The result shows that the software runs.
    - The error message is just about missing arguments which is normal. 

üí¨ Instead of providing the path in the command line, you can also add the application to `$PATH`. 

{:start="8"}
8. Change folder into `./gcta_1.93.2beta` if not there yet!
9. To add the current directory to `$PATH`:
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
    ```
10. You should now be able to run the program from any directory with simply:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    gcta64
    ```

## Some notes: 
üí° When adding paths to `$PATH`, always remember to include the current `$PATH`, or some of your normal shell commands etc. will stop working.

‚òùüèª To make the addition permanent, you can add the `export` command to your `$HOME/.bashrc`file. Instead of `$PWD` use the full path, something like:
    ```bash
    export PATH=/projappl/project_12345/gcta_1.93.2beta:$PATH
    ```

‚ÄºÔ∏è If you make changes to your environment (e.g. edit `.bashrc`), it is possible that there will be conflicts with CSC installed applications.

üí≠ If you have problems after making changes to your environment, it is possible to restore it to default state permanently or temporarily using the [csc-env command](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/using_csc_env/)
