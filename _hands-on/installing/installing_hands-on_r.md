# R

Puhti has several R version available as modules. You should start by checking
if one of these is suitable for you needs. 

To check available versions, use:
```bash
module spider r-env
```
It is also possible to install your own R packages.

See the [r-env-singularity](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env-singularity/) 
documentation for instructions.
