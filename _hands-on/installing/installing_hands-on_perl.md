# Perl

ðŸ’¬ Perl scripts and applications do not need installation. They can 
be simply downladed and run.

ðŸ’¬ To run Perl applications it usually best to first load a perl module.  
*There is a system perl installation that it is available without any modules, but it is very barebones and is missing many commonly used libraries.*

- To check available versions, use:
```bash
module spider perl
```
- By default the version `5.30.0`is loaded (19-07-21):
```bash
module load perl
```

ðŸ’¬ To make sure the applications uses the intended perl after loading a module you should either call it with perl:
```bash
perl my_app.pl
```
or make sure the shebang line of the script is:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env perl
```

## Installing Perl modules

ðŸ’¬ Sometimes the applications may require additional modules to run. These `perl modules`, should not be confused with the software modules in CSC computers.

ðŸ’¬ You should check the installation instructions for each module. For
libraries in CPAN, the easiest method is to use `cpanm`. You can check out [CPAN docs here.](https://metacpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/view/bin/cpanm).

#### In this example we add perl module JSON to our own environment

- We can check if JSON is already available:
```bash
perl -e 'use JSON;'
```
- We get an error message indicating that it is not found, so we need to install it.

ðŸ—¯ By default `cpanm` tries to install to perl installation location. You need to set the location to a 
directory where you have write access instead. It could be e.g. your project's /projappl directory. 

This can be done by setting a few environment variables:

- Substitute the desired path for PERL_BASE and run the following:
```bash
export PERL_BASE="/projappl/project_XXXXXX/YOURUSERNAME/myperl"   # an example path
export PERL_MM_OPT="INSTALL_BASE=$PERL_BASE"
export PERL_MB_OPT="--install_base $PERL_BASE"
export PERL5LIB="$PERL_BASE/lib/perl5"
```
- We can now install the module. In this case it is in CPAN, so we can use cpanm:
```bash
cpanm JSON
```

- To use it, we need to tell perl where to find it. In this case we set $PERL5LIB
environment variable: 
```bash
export PERL5LIB="/projappl/project_XXXXXX/YOURUSERNAME/myperl/lib/perl5"
```
- We can now try it again:
```bash
perl -e 'use JSON;'
```
- This time we do not get an error message indicating that JSON module is now usable.

## Additional info

ðŸ’¬ The installation only needs to be done once, but you need to make sure perl knows where to find 
the installed modules.

ðŸ’­ There are three main ways to do this (we used the second already):
1. Inlude command line option -I (capital i) with the path on the command line:
```bash
perl -I /projappl/project_XXXXXX/YOURUSERNAME/myperl/lib/perl5 ./my_app.pl
```
2. Include the path in `$PERL5LIB` environment variable.
```bash
export PERL5LIB=/projappl/project_XXXXXX/YOURUSERNAME/myperl/lib/perl5:${PERL5LIB}
```
3. Iclude the path in the perl code with `use lib`
```bash
    use lib '/projappl/project_XXXXXX/YOURUSERNAME/myperl/lib/perl5';
    use My::Module;
```

## Bioperl
If your code requires bioperl, we have a bioperl installation available.

See our [bioperl documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/bioperl/) for details.
