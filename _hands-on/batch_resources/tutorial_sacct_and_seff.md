# Using sacct and seff to look at finished jobs

ðŸ’¬ In this tutorial we look at commands `seff` and `sacct`.

`Seff` shows detailed data on used resources in an easy-to-read format, but can only show one job at a time.

`Sacct` is useful when you want to look at a listing of jobs, but by default it only shows minimal data.

- By default `sacct` shows the jobs you have run on current date (_i.e._ since last midnight):
```bash
sacct
```

- With the `-S` option you can specify the start time of listing.
```bash
sacct -S YYYY-MM-DD
```

- With the `-j` option you can specify a job id, and only look at a specific job.
```bash
sacct -j xxxxxxx
```

- You can select what data `sacct` shows. To see all available data for a job, you can use:
```bash
sacct -l -j xxxxxxx
```

- As there are a lot of data fields, it is usually better to select only the interesting ones. This can be done with the `-o` option.
    - For examaple to see job name, job id, used memory, job finish state and elapsed wall clock time you could use:
```bash
sacct -o jobname,jobid,maxrss,state,elapsed -j xxxxxx
```

- You can list all available data fields with:
```bash
sacct -e
```

ðŸ’­ It should be noted that running `sacct` is heavy on the batch job system, and you should not, for example, write scripts that run it repeatedly.

## Running a test job

Let's run a simple array job to look at.

- Create file `array.sh` and paste the following contents in to it.
    - Replace `project_xxxxxx` with your actual project name.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=project_xxx    # Choose the billing project. Has to be defined!
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00          # Maximum duration of the job. Max: depends of the partition. 
#SBATCH --partition=small        # Job queues: test, interactive, small, large, longrun, hugemem, hugemem_longrun
#SBATCH --job-name=array_job     # Name of the job visible in the queue.
#SBATCH --output=out_%A_%a.txt   # Name of the output-file.
#SBATCH --error=err_%A_%a.txt    # Name of the error-file.
#SBATCH --ntasks=1               # Number of tasks. Max: depends on partition.
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1        # How many processors work on one task. Max: Number of CPUs per node.
#SBATCH --mem=1000               # How much RAM is reserved for job per node. Unit: MiB
#SBATCH --array=1-6              # The indices of the array jobs.

/appl/soft/bio/course/sacct_exercise/test-a ${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}
```

- Submit the job with command:
```bash
sbatch array.sh
```
- You will see a message like:
```bash
Submitted batch job 123456
```
- Make note of the actual job id.

- You can follow the progress of the job with command:
```bash
squeue -u $USER
```
- How is an array job listed in the queue?

## Looking at the finished job

- When the job has finished (you can no longer see any of the sub jobs with `squeue`), you can use `sacct` to look at it. (Substitute xxxxx with your job id).
```bash
sacct -j xxxxxx
```
- In this case, we have only a few sub jobs, but if the array job is larger, it's probably clearer to look at just the jobs, and not at all the job steps. (Substitute xxxxx with your job id):
```bash
sacct -X -j xxxxxx
```
- `Sacct` is especially handy here, because it is easy to spot the 
failed sub jobs.
- Which sub jobs failed?
    - Can you figure out why they failed?
    - How do they comapre to jobs that finished?

- You can use `seff` to look at individual sub jobs. (Substitute xxxxx with your job id):
```bash
seff xxxxx_5
```
- You can also use `sacct` with the `-o` option we discussed above.
    - This time we also add fields `reqmem` (requested memory) and `timelimit` (requested time). 

ðŸ’­ Note that in this case we can not use the `-X` option, as we want to see memory usage for each step:

```bash
sacct -o jobname,jobid,reqmem,maxrss,timelimit,elapsed,state -j xxxxxx
```

- Also look at the error messages produced by the failed jobs.
- When you know which subjobs failed and why, you can adjust the resource requests as necessary, and re-run the failed subjobs:
    - Change time and memory reservations:
```bash
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00
#SBATCH --mem=2000
```
- Only rerun the failed sub jobs:
```bash
#SBATCH --array=3,5
```
- Did the jobs finish this time?
    - Use `seff` and `sacct` to look at the jobs. How much memory and time did they use?
