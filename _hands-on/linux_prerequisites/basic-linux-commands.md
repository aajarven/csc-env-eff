# Basic Linux commands

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è To begin make sure that you have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) and it is a member of a project that [has access to Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).

> ‚òùüèª You should also have already [logged to Puhti with ssh](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/connecting/ssh-puhti.html).

1. Now that you have logged in Puhti, check in which folder you are in: type `pwd` and hit Enter.
```bash
pwd
```
2. Check if there are any files:
```bash
ls
```
3. Make a directory and see if it appears:
```bash
mkdir YourNameTestFolder    # replace YourName
ls
```
4. Go to that folder. 
    - Note, that if you just type `cd` and the first letter of the folder name,  then hit 'tab' key, the terminal completes the name. Handy!
```bash
cd YourNameTestFolder       # replace YourName
```
5. Download a file into this new folder. Use the command `wget` for downloading from an URL:
```bash
wget https://github.com/CSCfi/csc-env-eff/raw/master/hands-on/linux_prerequisites/my-first-file.sh
```
6. Check what kind of file did you get and what size it is. 
    - Use `ls` command with some extra parameters:
```bash
ls -lth         # parameters are l for long format, t for sorting by time and h for convenient size units. Anything that starts with a hashtag is a comment and is not executed
```
7. Use `less` command to check out what the file looks like:
```bash
less my-first-file.sh
```
    - To exit the `less` preview of the file, hit 'q'. 

üí≠ Tip: Instead of `less` you can use `cat` which prints the content of the file(s) straight into command line. For long texts `less` is recommended.

8. Make a copy of this file:
```bash
cp my-first-file.sh YourName-first-file.sh  # replace YourName
ls -lth
less YourName-first-file.sh                 # replace YourName
```

9. Remove the file we originally downloaded (leave your own copy). 
```bash
rm my-first-file.sh
ls
```

üí° Tip: If you don't want to have duplicate files you can use `mv` to 'move/rename' the file. Syntax is the same: `mv [path/source] [path/destination]`.

## More information
- Learn [how to edit that file](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/linux_prerequisites/basic-file-editing.html) in the next tutorial!

üí° Pro-tip: if you remember *a part of a command* that you have used you can input it as `'string'` into command `history | grep 'string'` to see all your used commands that include the `'string'`.
