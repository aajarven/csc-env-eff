# Basic file editing

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è To begin make sure that you have a [user account at CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-user-account/) and it is a member of a project that [has access to Puhti service](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-add-service-access-for-project/).

> You have also already [logged to Puhti with ssh](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/connecting/ssh-puhti.html).

‚òùüèª NOTE: For graphical output to work you need to log in with `ssh -X YOURUSERNAME@puhti.csc.fi`

> In the [previous tutorial](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/linux_prerequisites/basic-linux-commands.html) we downloaded a file called `my-first-file.txt`, made a copy of it (`YourName-first-file.txt`), and now we practise how to edit it!

üí¨ These exercises are done with `nano` editor, but you can use your favorite editor too.  
üí° Here's the [nano cheet sheat](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/cheatsheet.html) 

### Processing text files

1. Open the file with `nano`:
```bash
nano YourName-first-file.txt      # replace YourName
```

2. Edit the file. Type something there!

3. Exit `nano` with (Ctrl + X), type Y to confirm saving and press enter to accept the filename.

4. Check that the modifications are actually there:
```bash
less YourName-first-file.txt      # replace YourName
```
    - Exit from preview with `q`.

### Processing images and pdf files

5. Download an image and a pdf:
```bash
wget https://github.com/csc-training/csc-env-eff/raw/master/slides/img/terminal_icon.png
wget https://github.com/csc-training/csc-env-eff/raw/master/slides/img/schrodingerscat.pdf
```

6. Open the image with:
```bash
eog terminal_icon.png
```
    - Close the preview window.

7. Open the pdf with:
```bash
evince schrodingerscat.pdf
```
    - Close the preview window with mouse or by pressing `Ctrl+C` when the Terminal-window is selected.

### Create text files

8. You can also create files with `nano`. Try simply:
```bash
nano YourName-markdown-file.md
```

9. In the text-file: write something eg. instructions for others how to replicate your file-creation process, save and close.
    - May I interest you with the [basic Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)?

10. Use `pwd` and copy the path of your current working directory

11. Copy the text-file to your personal computer for example with scp:  
‚ÄºÔ∏è NOTE: The following has to be typed in your personal computer's Terminal!
```bash
scp YOURUSERNAME@puhti.csc.fi:[path-to-your-wrkdir+the-file-name.md] [path-to-local-folder-in-your-PC]
```
12. Look for the file in your personal computer and check that the contents match.

### EXTRA: Open `html`-files in Puhti

#### Alternative 1: Firefox**  
1. Download a html-file to your folder in Puhti:
```bash
wget https://a3s.fi/mjaskeli-2004306-pub/index.html
```
2. Load Bioconda-module which includes Firefox:
```bash
module load Bioconda
```
3. The message says that you need to set the `PROJAPPL` environment variable.
    - To do so, run command (you can check the XXXXXXX of your project(s) with command `csc-workspaces`):
```bash
export PROJAPPL=/projappl/project_XXXXXXX
```
4. Re-run the ```module load Bioconda``` command:
```bash
module load bioconda
```
5. Open the file with Firefox
```bash
firefox index.html
```

#### Alternative 2: Allas

üí¨ After configuring Allas there's a-commands which include publishing files to the internet. This is instructed in [Allas-tutorial](https://csc-training.github.io/csc-env-eff/hands-on/allas/tutorial_allas-file-transfer.html)
